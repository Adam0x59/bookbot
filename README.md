# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Usage: python3 main.py <path_to_book>

Takes a text file containing the text of a book, outputs the wordcount and a count of each alphabetical character in descending order. 

Additional feature goal: To get a little more experience here are some feature ideas I MAY add...

 - [x] Average word Length
 - [-] Average sentence Length
 - [ ] 10 Most common words used
 - [ ] 10 Least common words used
